# Factory Equipment Failure Classification

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on building machine learning classification models to predict equipment failures based on factory sensor data. The goal is to identify potential failures early and reduce downtime.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- Factory equipment sensor readings (categorical and numerical features).
- Target variable: Failure (Yes/No).

## ðŸ›  Methods
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling).
- Applied classification models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Evaluated models using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision/Recall
  - F1-score
  - Confusion matrix

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Best performing model: **Random Forest Classifier** with ~85% accuracy.
- Provided feature importance insights for key sensors.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
