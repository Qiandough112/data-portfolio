# Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project applies deep learning techniques to classify images using CNN architectures. It demonstrates the effectiveness of convolutional layers for feature extraction.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- Image dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10 / MNIST).
- Classes: Multiple categories depending on dataset.

## ðŸ›  Methods
- Data preprocessing (normalization, augmentation).
- Built CNN with:
  - Convolutional layers
  - Pooling layers
  - Fully connected layers
- Training with:
  - Cross-entropy loss
  - Adam optimizer
- Hyperparameter tuning (batch size, epochs, learning rate).

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Achieved ~90% test accuracy after tuning.
- CNN outperformed baseline Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries
- Python (PyTorch/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib)
