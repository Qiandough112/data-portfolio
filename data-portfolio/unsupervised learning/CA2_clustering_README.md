# Customer Segmentation using Clustering

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project applies unsupervised learning (clustering) techniques for customer segmentation. The goal is to group customers into meaningful clusters for targeted marketing.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- Customer demographic and transaction data.
- Features: Age, income, spending score, etc.

## ðŸ›  Methods
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
- Applied clustering models:
  - K-means clustering
  - Hierarchical clustering
- Used **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** to determine optimal cluster number.
- Data visualization with scatterplots and heatmaps.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Identified 4 customer segments:
  - High income, high spending
  - Low income, low spending
  - Young high spenders
  - Older moderate spenders

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
