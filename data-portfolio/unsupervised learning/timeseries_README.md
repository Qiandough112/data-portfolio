# Trial Experiments for Clustering & Forecasting

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This notebook contains experimental work for testing clustering and time-series forecasting models. It serves as a sandbox for model prototyping before finalizing CA2.

## ðŸ›  Methods
- Tried different clustering models (K-means, Agglomerative).
- Time-series decomposition using seasonal-trend analysis.
- Trial evaluation metrics (Silhouette Score, MAE, MAPE).

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Provided baseline metrics and visualizations to refine final project approach.
